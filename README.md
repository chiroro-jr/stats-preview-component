# Frontend Mentor - Stats preview card component

![Design preview for the Stats preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this repository for my solution to a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenge. This platform helps you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. Check them out if you want to improve your frontend developer skills and spice up your GitHub profile.

## The challenge

The challenge was to build out this card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. I like to do the same challenge using different technologies. For example, I can use TailwindCSS then try to do the same challenge using vanilla HTML and CSS.

## Where to find everything

As mentioned, I like to implement the solution to the same challenge using different technologies so that I get a feel for them and broaden my skills and perspective. For each technology stack I used, I created a separate branch. Check them out using the links below.
