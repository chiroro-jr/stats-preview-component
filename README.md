## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build tool and dev server

### What I learned

- Tailwind CSS makes it easy to think about CSS. Of course you still have to know CSS to use it, but it makes things a lot easier. All your CSS is in your markup therefore you don't need to go back and forth between your markup and your styles. You are always in your HTML file which is a big plus. Your markup will be a lot more cluttered, but that's a tradeoff I can take for the benefits it brings.
- Tailwind CSS has amazing defaults for things like screen size. You don't have to worry about that as compared to starting from scratch.

### Continued development

I plan on doing the same challenge using more technologies. I might use vanilla HTML and CSS or some other technology in the future. I want to do this to get a feel for what it's like to do the same thing using different technologies. Hopefully this will broaden my knowledge and perspective. I have already set up a GitHub repo that will direct you to all the solutions for this challenge using different tech stacks.
